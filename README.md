# Quicksort Pivots

in the lectures I only briefly mentioned strategies for determining a good pivot
for quicksort. The implementation on the slides simply picks the leftmost
element in the part of the array that we consider as a pivot. I also mentioned a
few other ways of picking a good pivot, e.g. randomly.

Median-of-three is also a good way of picking a pivot -- inspect the first,
middle, and last elements of the part of the array under consideration and
choose the median value. Using the probabilities for picking a pivot in a
particular part of the array (in the same way as we did on slide 34), argue
whether this method is more or less (or equally) likely to pick a good pivot
compared to simply choosing the first element. Assume that all permutations are
equally likely, i.e. the input array is ordered randomly.

Your answer must derive probabilities for choosing a good pivot and
quantitatively reason with them.

In assuming a randomly ordered input array with n elements, picking the first element yields a 1/n chance of being the true median value. This is inferior to the odds utilizing the median-of-three method as we now have ((1)/(n-2)) (assuming n >= 3) odds of picking the true median value with this method. (the two values that happen to not be the median we need not worry about anymore) On top of these slightly better odds, we have the added benefit of avoiding the worst case; that being one in which we choose the smallest or largest value as the pivot.
